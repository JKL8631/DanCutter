# Dan Cutter

A python program made to cut osu!mania's dans into their respective maps for training purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll just need the .osu file of the map you want to cut.

### Installation

Download the latest release in the release tab.

## Startup

Executing the .exe file will bring out the GUI. You'll first need to input the path and the break length of the map, then, you can analyze it and see the number of maps the program found. If you're good with that, you can start the splitting process, which will create the new maps as new difficulties of the original map. You can always cancel the splitting if you notice the number of maps found is not matching, in that case, try to tweak the break length.
